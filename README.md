Project - Hyperparameter Database under TA, Project Manager: Prabhu Subramanian

Sub Project - Creating a conceptual model and storing all the data into a physical database for different datasets in order to contribute to the hyperparameter database.

Objective – The main challenge is to gather as much data sets and different types of domains  like soccer players data and store in a database. Then the analyses to find dependent parameters for each dataset so as to interpret the requirements of public user data. This will be achieved by writing as much queries as possible. Further analyzing which other information is necessary for getting better output of the search results. Thus the project will serve for better and faster results for people who need to decide about which parameters are required for their datasets. 

Description - We will be using MySQL and python for overall project completion. Also we will be interacting data science students to work on machine learning aspect. We will be working on current ER diagrams and understanding the project and its scope to develop a flexible webpage for everyone to get their required parameters for different kinds of data they input to the search field. We would like to work in coordination with data science members to understand new concepts related to deep learning. 

Data Sources – Kaggle and GitHub repositories.
